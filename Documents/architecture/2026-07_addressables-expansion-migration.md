# Addressables expansion & migration

Scopes turning this fork's already-configured but functionally inert Addressables setup into the
thing it's supposed to be: on-demand async asset loading with ref-counting and unload, instead of
every configured asset being hard-referenced into RAM at startup.

## Why

Upstream tracks this exact problem as
[RE-SS3D/SS3D#1494](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/issues/1494) ("Excessive memory usage" — up to
600MB from `AssetDatabase.Assets` directly referencing everything from the start) and has an open,
unreviewed rewrite attempting to fix it:
[RE-SS3D/SS3D#1500](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/pull/1500) ("Make adressables great again").

This fork has the identical root cause today, independently of upstream's PR. Investigated
2026-07-21:

## Current state (this fork)

- **Addressables package is present and configured.** `com.unity.addressables` **2.9.1** pinned
  directly in `Packages/manifest.json` (Unity 6), active settings at
  `Assets/Content/Addressables/AddressableAssetSettings.asset`, with **22 configured groups**
  (Items, Materials, Sounds, ParticlesEffects, InteractionIcons, UIElements, Settings, Scenes,
  Built In Data, Default Local Group, plus Localization package locale/table groups). CraftingRecipes
  group was purged with TECH_DEBT 1.6.
- **Runtime Addressables loading exists for InteractionIcons only (Phase 3).** Other databases still
  use eager `AssetDatabase.Assets` hard refs + sync `Assets.Get`. Shared infrastructure:
  `AssetHandle<T>` / `AssetProvider` / `Assets.GetAsync` / `AssetDatabaseLoadMode.AddressablesAsync`.
- **Orphaned cruft removed (Phase 1):** `Assets/AddressableAssetsData/` deleted; single settings root
  is `Assets/Content/Addressables/`.
- **Already-acknowledged debt pointing at this gap:**
  [data-codegen.md](systems/data-codegen.md) § Architecture smells,
  [ui-shell.md](systems/ui-shell.md) / [2026-07_ui-shell-consolidation.md](2026-07_ui-shell-consolidation.md)
  (MI/Main HUD/Storage still `Resources.Load`), [TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md) § 1.5 / § 1.15.

## What upstream PR #1500 offers (and why not to merge it wholesale)

The PR's shape is a reasonable reference design:

- `AssetRequest<T>` / `AssetHandle<T>` — ref-counted, disposable, async load handles replacing
  direct object references
- `AssetProvider`, `AssetLifecycleTracker`, `InstanceLifetimeTracker` — dedupe concurrent loads,
  track live instances for unload
- `NetworkBarrier` / `PreloadCondition` — FishNet-specific: makes clients preload an asset before a
  networked spawn RPC references it, and gives prefabs deterministic GUID-based network IDs instead
  of relying on FishNet's default prefab-collection index
- Deletes the legacy static `Assets` lookup entirely once migrated

It is **not mergeable as-is**: it targets Unity 2021.3 + upstream's pre-fork `Data/` layout, this
fork has diverged substantially (Unity 6, different codegen, ~641 commits ahead), it's unreviewed
even upstream, and it migrates ~470 call sites/assets in one shot with only automated test coverage
(no confirmed manual multiplayer smoke). Adopt the **design** — async handle + ref-count model, and
critically the network-preload-barrier idea, since this fork is multiplayer-first via FishNet just
like upstream — not the diff.

## Target model

1. **`AssetHandle<T>`-style async load/release** replacing `Assets.Get<T>` — `AssetDatabase.Get<T>`
   becomes `async Task<AssetHandle<T>> GetAsync<T>(id)` (or a Unity-idiomatic
   `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync` wrapper), ref-counted so multiple callers requesting the same asset
   share one load and release triggers `Addressables.Release` only when the count hits zero.
2. **Keep the existing `AssetDatabase`/`Assets` id-lookup surface and codegen** (`DatabaseID` +
   per-asset string id, `Generated/AssetDatabases.cs`) — this is orthogonal to sync-vs-async and
   already works; only the storage/retrieval mechanism underneath changes from a hard-referenced
   dictionary to an Addressables key lookup.
3. **FishNet spawn ordering** — any networked prefab or synced asset reference needs to be resolvable
   client-side before the spawn/RPC that uses it lands, same problem upstream's `NetworkBarrier`
   solves. Needs a concrete design pass against this fork's `NetworkSpawner`/`NetworkObjectsGenerator`
   equivalents (see [networking-session.md](systems/networking-session.md)) rather than assuming
   upstream's mechanism transfers unchanged.
4. **Migrate database-by-database, not all at once** — start with a database that's easy to verify in
   isolation and has no networked-spawn dependency (e.g. `InteractionIcons` — UI-only, no FishNet
   path) before touching anything that gates a networked prefab spawn (`Items`).

## Phases

1. **Cleanup + baseline** — **done (2026-07-23).** Deleted orphaned `Assets/AddressableAssetsData/`;
   pinned `com.unity.addressables` 2.9.1 in manifest; confirmed settings:
   - Active settings: `Assets/Content/Addressables/` (`DefaultObject` GUID points here).
   - `m_ActivePlayerDataBuilderIndex: 3` = PackedMode; `m_BuildRemoteCatalog: 0`; local profiles only.
   - **`m_BuildAddressablesWithPlayerBuild: 0` kept** — do not flip without verifying CI/player build
     scripts. Content builds remain an explicit Editor step (Addressables Groups window → Build →
     New Build → Default Build Script) or a future pipeline hook.
   - **Baseline verification checklist:**
     - [ ] Editor Play Mode still resolves Localization Addressables (indirect; already working).
     - [ ] Manual Addressables content build against `Content/Addressables` succeeds (no missing-schema).
     - [ ] InteractionIcons radial icons visible after Phase 3 preload (Editor Play Mode).
     - Player-build streaming is **not** proven by Editor Play Mode alone (Editor fast-path can mask
       failures) — see Open questions.
2. **Async handle infrastructure** — **done (2026-07-23).** `AssetHandle<T>`, `AssetProvider`,
   `IAssetLoadBackend` / `AddressablesLoadBackend`, `Assets.GetAsync`, EditMode
   `AssetProviderTests` (ref-count share, double-release, missing key, preload cache, concurrent dedupe).
   Sync `Assets.Get` remains for non-migrated DBs.
3. **First migration slice: `InteractionIcons`** — **done (2026-07-23).**
   `LoadMode = AddressablesAsync`; GUID keys in `AssetKeys`; serialized `Assets` dict emptied;
   warm preload at `ApplicationInitializing` via `Assets.PreloadAddressableDatabases()`;
   sync `Get` / `InteractionIconLookup` read the Addressables cache; sprite builder still authors
   PNGs→Sprites into the Addressables group (no longer relies on eager SO refs for runtime).
4. **Network-spawn-coupled databases (`Items`, `Materials`)** — requires the
   FishNet preload-ordering design from Target model §3 to land first.
5. **Remove sync `Assets.Get<T>` path** once all call sites are migrated; delete the now-redundant
   `SerializableDictionary<string, Object> Assets` field and `LoadAssetsFromAssetGroup` eager-copy
   step from `AssetDatabase.cs`.
6. **Retire the per-surface `Resources.Load` catalogs** ([TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md) § 1.4) — this
   is the concrete mechanism, not a vague fold-in:

   | Surface | Today | After |
   |---|---|---|
   | Machine UI | `MachineUiAssetPaths` consts + committed `MachineUiAssetCatalog` SO, rebuilt via **SS3D → Machine Interface → Rebuild Asset Catalog** (`MachineUiAssetCatalogBuilder.cs`), loaded with `Resources.Load` | `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<VisualTreeAsset>("mi/<template>")` (or the `AssetHandle<T>` wrapper from §1) against a stable address; no committed catalog SO |
   | Main HUD | `MainHudAssetPaths` + `MainHudAssetCatalog` SO, rebuilt via **SS3D → Main HUD → Rebuild Asset Catalog** (`MainHudAssetCatalogBuilder.cs`) | same pattern, `"mainhud/<template>"` addresses |
   | Storage Panel | `StoragePanelAssetCatalog`, rebuilt via **SS3D → Storage Panel → Rebuild Asset Catalog** (`StoragePanelAssetCatalogBuilder.cs`) | same pattern, `"storagepanel/<template>"` addresses |

   The failure mode this removes: today, forgetting to re-run a rebuild menu after adding/renaming a
   UXML/USS asset leaves the committed catalog SO silently serving a stale reference — nothing catches
   it until Play Mode or a build. With Addressables addressing there is no second catalog to go stale;
   the Addressables group config *is* the source of truth, and a missing/renamed address fails loudly
   (`LoadAssetAsync` throws/logs "key not found") at the point of use instead of silently no-op'ing.
   Migrate MI first (best-understood surface, see [2026-07_mi-path-catalog.md](2026-07_mi-path-catalog.md)),
   then Main HUD, then Storage Panel; delete each `*AssetCatalog` SO + Editor rebuild menu once its
   surface is migrated.

   **What this does *not* remove:** `InteractionIconSpriteBuilder` (**SS3D → Interactions → Rebuild
   Interaction Icon Sprites**) is a content-authoring step — generating `Sprite` assets from source
   PNGs, including the `Sprite.Create`-goes-null workaround documented in
   [data-codegen.md](systems/data-codegen.md) § Pitfalls — not a loading-mechanism problem. That menu
   still needs to exist; only its *output* (the generated sprites) should land in an Addressables
   group loaded async like everything else in this doc, rather than the eager `AssetDatabase`
   dictionary it uses today.

## Open questions / risks

- **Bundle build verification.** Content-bundle build path still needs a real player build-and-run
  pass; Editor Play Mode can mask load failures via the Editor fast-path. Checklist above tracks the
  manual content build; CI gate not yet added.
- **Dedicated server implications.** `UNITY_SERVER` builds ([FORK_STATUS.md](../FORK_STATUS.md) §
  Headless dedicated server) skip renderers/audio but still need correct gameplay assets — async
  loading changes startup-order assumptions there too (InteractionIcons preload is client-UI-only,
  low risk; Items migration will not be).
- **Test coverage:** EditMode `AssetProviderTests` cover handle/ref-count with a fake backend.
  End-to-end Addressables load in Play Mode / player build still manual.

## Explicit non-goals (this doc)

- Porting upstream PR #1500's code directly — design reference only, per above.
- Migrating MI/Main HUD/Storage Panel onto `UiShellSubSystem` — that's
  [2026-07_ui-shell-consolidation.md](2026-07_ui-shell-consolidation.md)'s own later phases; this
  effort only makes their eventual catalog migration land on async Addressables loading instead of
  the current `Resources.Load` pattern once that migration happens.
- Scene/bundle-based Addressables (remote content delivery, CDN hosting) — local-bundle async
  loading only, matching this fork's build-from-source / manual-prerelease distribution model
  ([FORK_STATUS.md](../FORK_STATUS.md)).
