# Electricity

## Overview

Power circuit simulation, APC channel gating, SMES storage, and tile-linked electric devices under namespace `SS3D.Systems.Electricity`. Implements `ITileMutationObserver` for [tile](tile.md) placement reactions. Machine UI in [machine-interface](machine-interface.md). **Area-scoped power:** devices in an assigned area draw from that area's APC without a cable path to each device; the APC still connects to the station grid via cables. Channel gating and load accounting use [area](area.md) `TryGetEffectiveApcForDevice`. Per-tick APC consumer membership is indexed on `ElectricitySubSystem` (invalidated on device add/remove and area rebuild). Furniture/visuals gate power via `PowerGate`. **Solar:** `SolarPanel` producers on the HV cable grid with aim × stub `SolarCycle` output; `SolarTrackingBeacon` auto-aims nearby panels (world Toggle, no MI).

## Unit model

- **Flow** (generators, consumers, UI): **kW** — instantaneous demand/supply per tick.
- **Storage** (SMES, APC cell): **kWh** — energy reservoir.
- **Tick interval:** `ElectricitySubSystem._tickRate` (default **0.2 s**). Conversions live in `ElectricityUnits.cs`.
- Per tick: `energy_kWh = power_kW × tickSeconds / 3600`.

## Power distribution

1. **Cable phase** — `Circuit.UpdateCableDistributionOnly`: producers feed cable-distributed consumers; surplus stored in `_pendingProducerSurplus`; SMES discharges on deficit.
2. **Area phase** — `AreaApcPowerDistribution.PowerAreaConsumers`: each APC draws grid headroom (`GetAvailableGridSupplyForArea`), then its cell covers remaining deficit (consumers from per-APC index).
3. **Charge phase** — `Circuit.ChargePendingProducerSurplus`: leftover surplus charges non-APC storages (SMES), respecting per-device charge rate.

**Load shedding:** `PowerConsumerAllocation.AllocateUnderBudget` — under insufficient supply, Equipment sheds first, then Environment, then Lighting (restore order is reverse). Applies to both cable and area distribution.

**HV cables:** underfloor Wire-layer runs connect generators, SMES units, and APCs only. Lights, vending machines, air alarms, airlocks, and other area consumers are not cable-linked; they draw from their area APC.

**Consumer visuals:** `ConsumerPowerVisual` dims emissive materials (and optional panel indicators) from `BasicPowerConsumer` / `MachinePowerConsumer` power status and APC channel gating via `PowerGate`. Wired on vendor/jukebox prefabs, air alarms, and airlock panel lights.

**Balancing defaults (prefabs):** APC cell 5 kWh / 10 kW charge & discharge; SMES 100 kWh / 50 kW, starts charged with output enabled; solar panel peak 2 kW.

## Start here

- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/ElectricityUnits.cs` — kW ↔ kWh conversion for tick interval
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/PowerStorageMath.cs` — shared APC/SMES/battery charge/discharge helpers
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/PowerGate.cs` — `IsPowered` / `IsChannelOpen` / `IsEffectivelyPowered`
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/PowerConsumerAllocation.cs` — channel-priority consumer budgeting
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/ElectricitySubSystem.cs` — subsystem entry point; `IWorldReady`; awaits `AreasFlooded` then notifies `ElectricityReady`; per-APC consumer index
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/AreaApcPowerDistribution.cs` — area APC powers local consumers without per-device cables
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/ApcStatusDeriver.cs` — APC power/battery state derivation
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/ElectricCableConnectivity.cs` — HV cable links only grid backbone devices
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/Circuit.cs` — cable-grid power distribution; per-consumer channel resolver
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/LightPower.cs` — fixture visuals from power + area lighting state; client path uses floor-cache area id + lighting snapshot
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/ConsumerPowerVisual.cs` — emissive/panel dimming for generic consumers
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/BasicPowerConsumer.cs` — constant-load consumer
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/MachinePowerConsumer.cs` — idle/in-use load consumer
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/FuelPowerGenerator.cs` — Pacman generator (`IPowerProducer` + toggle FX)
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/SolarCycle.cs` — stub sun azimuth / intensity / eclipse for solar output
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/SolarPanel.cs` — solar `IPowerProducer` + Rotate aim
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/SolarTrackingBeacon.cs` — auto-aim nearby panels (Toggle, no MI)
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/Editor/ElectricityContentPrefabRecipes.cs` — tier-B solar prefab wiring aggregator
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Electricity/MachineVibrate.cs` — client vibrate FX; capture rest rotation on enable (not `OnStart`)
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/Systems/Tile/Connections/BasicElectricDevice.cs` — tile-placed electric device base
- `Assets/Scripts/SS3D/UI/MachineInterface/ApcController.cs` — APC façade; `IAreaApcOrigin` + storage SyncVars + MI

## Extension points

- New powered devices: attach `BasicPowerConsumer` or `MachinePowerConsumer` plus `ConsumerPowerVisual`; gate gameplay with `PowerGate.IsPowered(..., NullConsumerPolicy)` (Allow = null means powered; Deny = null means unpowered).
- Prefab examples: vendors/jukebox (`MachinePowerConsumer` + `ConsumerPowerVisual`); air alarm/airlocks (`BasicPowerConsumer`, Environment channel); light switch uses [area](area.md) `LightSwitchController` instead.
- HV cable graph: only `IPowerProducer` and `IPowerStorage` participate via `ElectricCableConnectivity.ParticipatesInCableGrid`; consumers draw from area APCs. Solar panels follow the Pacman producer path (FurnitureBase + `ElectricDeviceAdjacencyConnector` + Wire cable to SMES/APC).
- Solar content prefabs: re-run `SS3D/Electricity/Run Content Prefab Recipes` (`SolarPrefabSetup`) after merge conflicts — do not hand-edit mega-prefab YAML. Recipe nests the full `SolarPanel.fbx` (base/arm/armature/panel) under a `Model` child; do not extract a single mesh.
- Machine panels: register via [machine-interface](machine-interface.md). Solar tracker/panels intentionally have **no** MI (diegetic Toggle / Rotate only).
- Area membership changes: Area APC register/unregister/rebuild calls `ElectricitySubSystem.InvalidateAreaConsumerIndex()`.
- Powered-device init: await `ElectricityReady` / `WorldReady` (`IWorldReady` / `WorldReadinessSubSystem`) — obsolete `IsSetUp` is an `IsReady` shim only.

## Pitfalls

- **`CircuitsTick` GC at SS13 scale:** per-tick `new List<>` / LINQ `ToList` in area APC power and `Circuit` cable distribute (~25 MB / 76 ticks on Metastation). Hot path must reuse scratch buffers: `FillActiveConsumers` / `AllocateUnderBudget(..., results)` / `PowerAreaConsumers(..., poweredScratch, poweredSetScratch)` and `Circuit` instance scratches. Do not restore allocating helpers on the 0.2 s tick. Hit 2026-07-28 (`SS3D.Electricity.CircuitsTick`).
- **`RemoveElectricalElement` must not require a live `TileObject`.** `BasicElectricDevice.TileObject` is null during `OnDestroyed` (Unity fake-null). Bailing on null left zombies in `_registeredDevices` → NRE in `RebuildElectricGraph`/`ToCoordinates` after `TileMap.Clear` (Map Editor load, DMM import with Clear). Unregister by device reference; prune null-`TileObject` entries on rebuild. Hit 2026-07-28.
- **`TileMap.Clear` vs FishNet despawn:** Clear empties `_chunks` before despawn finishes. Orphan cables still report `TileObject` but `GetChunk` is null → NRE in `ElectricNeighbourLookup.GetElectricDevicesOnSameTile`. Neighbour lookup must null-check map/chunk; rebuild prunes chunkless devices. Hit on MetaStation DMM import 2026-07-28.
- **Interface-typed destroyed devices throw, not null.** `IElectricDevice device?.TileObject` does **not** Unity-null-check — a destroyed `ApcController` still invokes `get_TileObject` → `MissingReferenceException`. Use `device is Object u && u` before `TileObject`, and keep `ApcController.TileObject` as `this ? GetComponent… : null` (same as `BasicElectricDevice`). Full DMM import suspends circuit ticks + clears the registry around Clear/place. Hit 2026-07-28.
- **Walls invisible until adjacency refresh finishes:** DMM import places with `skipAdjacency`, then `RefreshAllAdjacencies`. Airlocks are full meshes so they appear first; walls/windows need the adjacency pass. Mid-import electricity spam can make a full MetaStation import look “doors only” until the apply finishes cleanly.
- **Never assign `Inactive` then `Powered` in the same tick.** `PowerStatus` is a SyncVar; OnChange fires on every real transition. Furniture (notably [furniture](furniture.md) airlocks) treats `Inactive` as a power-loss edge. Clear-then-set every ~0.2s tick restarts close timers forever. `PowerAreaConsumers` must write the final status once (and skip no-ops). Cable path in `Circuit` already does single-assignment — keep area path aligned. Test: `PowerAreaConsumers_AssignsFinalStatusOnceWithoutFlicker`.
- **`PowerStatus` setter must allow EditMode/offline.** Guard pure clients with `NetworkObject != null && NetworkObject.IsSpawned && !IsServer` (not bare `!IsServer`). Bare `IsServer` NREs when `_networkObjectCache` is null, and treating all non-server as skip leaves Circuit EditMode tests stuck at `Inactive`. Same pattern as [tile](tile.md) adjacency SyncVar publishes / `PlacedTileObject.CanWriteIntegritySyncVars`.
- **Client light fixtures ignore APC / wall-switch toggles:** Host `LightPower` can read live APC channels from the area registry; pure clients cannot. Fixture lit mode is a **server SyncVar** (`LightPower._fixtureVisual`); clients only apply it. Do not re-derive emit on clients from area/obsolete `IsSetUp`. `ApcController.OnChannelsChanged` refreshes fixtures on the server so the SyncVar updates immediately.
- **Machine "Turn on" snaps facing to prefab/default:** `MachineVibrate` used to cache rest rotation in `OnStart`, then force it when Enable becomes true. Tile-placed machines (Pacman / `FuelPowerGenerator`) often get their final yaw later (spawn sync, `PlacedTileObject` direction). Capture rest pose when vibration starts, restore it when stopping — never from a stale Start snapshot.
- **Solar aim visual vs placement yaw:** `SolarPanel` SyncVar aim drives world yaw independently of tile placement direction. Never assign `rotation = Euler(0, yaw, 0)` on an FBX armature bone — that zeros Blender rest pitch/roll and tumbles the rig toward north. Capture rest, strip world-Y, then `AngleAxis(yaw, up) * restNoYaw`. Prefer aim transform = `Model` (FBX root), not a skinned bone.

## Depends on / Used by

- **Depends on:** [tile](tile.md), [area](area.md) (channel gating + lighting state)
