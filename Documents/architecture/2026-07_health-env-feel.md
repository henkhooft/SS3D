# Health env + feel polish (Jul 2026)

Phased health-feel pass that closed the silent gaps between vitals, presentation, turf atmosphere, and audio. Advances [mvp1-nuke-ops.md](../milestones/mvp1-nuke-ops.md) **M7** (crit feel) and **M8 exposure** without seal/internals. Cursor plan: `health_feel_integrations` (`.cursor/plans/`). Navigation: [systems/health.md](systems/health.md), [systems/audio.md](systems/audio.md), [systems/screen-effects.md](systems/screen-effects.md).

## Shipped

| Phase | What |
|-------|------|
| 1 Critical ragdoll | `BodyPresentationIntent` collapses on `HealthState.Critical` (and cardiac), not only `!IsConscious` |
| 2 Critical screen FX | Dying vignette preferred over LowOxy washout; F2 solos not wiped by health mapper |
| 3 Turf → health | Oxy math fix; O₂→CO₂ breath exchange; PO₂ breathability; hot/cold/fire all-zone burn; pressure → lungs; alert/screen merge; `atmosdamage` toggle |
| 4 Blood VFX | On-hit spray ObserversRpc + tuned trickle |
| 5 SFX | FreeSound heartbeat/heavy breathing + SS14 beep/blood/flesh + SS3D-Art gasp/choke/scream; health breathing max-merged with stamina; positional hit/gasp/scream |

Also on this branch (adjacent feel): stance-aware Base `Flinch` + soft Additive gut overlay ([entities](systems/entities.md)).
