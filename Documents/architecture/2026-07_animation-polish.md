# Animation polish — melee torso, limp, blend-tree ownership (Jul 2026)

Follow-on to [2026-07_player-body-animation.md](2026-07_player-body-animation.md). Navigation: [systems/entities.md](systems/entities.md).

## Decisions

| Topic | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Melee swing torso | Upper Body mask includes spine/chest (head excluded); Mixamo swing owns torso; look-at head-only during Attack Swing |
| Limp in combat | Yes — Injured Locomotion from Male Injured Pack enters from Peaceful/Melee/Ranged when `LimpSide != 0` |

## What shipped

1. **Melee torso authority** — `HumanoidUpperBodyMask` spine+chest on; Melee stance keeps Upper Body layer weight at 1; `AttackSwing` is Animator trigger + exit-time (no C# swing duration / `Animator.Play`).
2. **Look-at** — `HumanoidIkController` reads Upper Body state `Attack Swing` and zeros body look-at weight for that window.
3. **Injured gait** — `Injured Locomotion 2D` blend from Male Injured Pack; rebuild menu wires limp entry/exit for all stances.
4. **Injured arms** — `HumanoidBodyStateBridge` feeds `SetInjuredArms` from arm zone brute; Additive `Empty Additive` remapped to hurting idle at 0.4 weight.
5. **Rebuild tooling** — `HumanoidLocomotionBlendSetup` builds Injured tree; optional `artifacts/force-rebuild-animator.flag` one-shot when interactive Editor holds the project.
6. **Left-hand mirror** — `Hand.Side` + snapshot `MirrorUpperBody` bool; Upper Body Hold*/Attack Swing* states use Animator mirror parameter (not Base Layer locomotion).

## Who tunes what (after polish)

| Owner | Owns |
|-------|------|
| Animator | Swing exit time, limp transitions, blend samples, upper-body mask, AttackSwing Any State |
| Code | `CombatStance`, `LimpSide`, `InjuredArm*`, `VelX`/`VelZ`, `MirrorUpperBody`, fire `AttackSwing` trigger, Melee layer weight on/off, look-at aim smoothing |

Intentional leftovers in code: Upper Body weight lerp for stance enter/leave; locomotion velocity snap into the blend tree; look-at lerp. Do not reintroduce swing wall-clock timers.

## Out of scope / follow-ups

- Combat windup telegraph length vs Mixamo swing (shorten Attack Swing state speed in controller, or add windup pose later)
- Side-specific limp L/R clips (pack is not side-split; `LimpSide` still set for future bias)
- Body-presentation-authority collapse path
