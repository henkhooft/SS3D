# Clothing folded vs worn presentation

Shipped: single-NO world form via `ClothingItemPresentation` on jumpsuit base (`JumpsuitGrey`); variants inherit. Orphan `JumpsuitSecurityFolded` removed from content, Addressables, and `DefaultPrefabObjects`.

Armor Phase 5 still uses `JumpsuitSecurity` + `ArmorItemExtension` on that same Item.
