# Self-hosted CI + multiplayer harness (Phases 0–2)

Implements [Documents/architecture/2026-07_multiplayer-testing-self-hosted-ci.md](../architecture/2026-07_multiplayer-testing-self-hosted-ci.md).

## Phase 0 status (2026-07-24)

- Runner `TomNAS-unity` registered and **online** (user systemd unit + linger).
- Docker group + image `unityci/editor:ubuntu-6000.3.16f1-linux-il2cpp-3` pulled.
- Library stash path: `/home/cu6e/.cache/ss3d/Library`.
- Workflow YAML updated for self-hosted + stash `mv` + nightly.
- **Next:** push + `workflow_dispatch`; prove cold then warm smoke.

## Where work happens

| Machine | Role |
|---------|------|
| Dev machine | Edit workflows/harness/C#; push; `workflow_dispatch` |
| TomNAS (`ssh tomnas`) | Runner + Docker + Library stash; executes self-hosted jobs |

See the Cursor plan / architecture effort for Phases 1–2 detail.
