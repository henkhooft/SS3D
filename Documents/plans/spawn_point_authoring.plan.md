# Spawn Point Authoring (Map Editor + Save)

Implements [creative-mode.md](../design/creative-mode.md) §8 **authoring + save only**. See architecture effort [2026-07_spawn-point-authoring.md](../architecture/2026-07_spawn-point-authoring.md).

## Implementation notes

- Job catalog tags are hardcoded to current `RoleData` names (`Assistant`, `Security`) via `MapEditorSpawnCatalog.DefaultJobNames` — extend that list when new roles ship.
- `TileMap.Clear` clears the spawn registry so templates without a `spawn-points` chunk cannot leave stale markers.
- EditMode filter `SpawnPointAuthoringTests` could not be batch-run while the Unity Editor held the project lock; tests are in place for the next EditMode run.
