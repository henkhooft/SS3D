# Map editor placement validation and scoped delete

Shipped. See [Documents/architecture/systems/tile.md](../architecture/systems/tile.md) Pitfalls.

## Implementation notes

- `BuildChecker.Evaluate` returns `BuildFailReason[]`; `PreviewResult` carries `Failures` + `PrimaryMessage`.
- Map editor place (`PlaceTileCommand`, `MoveTileCommand`, `RpcPlaceObject`) uses `skipBuildCheck: false`. Client `PlaceOnHolograms` pre-checks and skips invalid cells; toasts primary reason / skipped count.
- Delete / eraser clears only targets from `MapEditorDeleteTargeting` for `CurrentSubcategory` (wall mounts filtered by hologram `Direction`). Overlays clear floor decals; Items mode still raycasts items.
- Delete tool keeps a cursor ghost (prefab of first target when present, else a tinted marker) and supports line / Shift+rectangle drag erase.
